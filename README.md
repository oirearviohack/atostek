# Atostek Oirearviohack

## Idea - Cough map

World has a lot of wasted coughing. With our app you can record and store your coughs for other people to see. By seeing a map of coughs you can avoid those areas when coughing becomes epidemic.

This concept is a perfect application for a public and national welfare instance. It helps to prevent the distibution of cough related diseases and healthcare units can better prepare to reserver resources.

This application can be enhanced to actually listen the coughs on a mobile device. Easy start is to listen ambient coughs first. This can be boraded to incorporate an application or algorithm to really diagnose the type of cough.

Other future ideas are:
- Inform local residents to wash their hands better when cough related diseases become epidemic.
- Extend the application to input other symptoms manually such as body temperature, headache, etc.
- Extend the application to input other disease symptoms also such as diarrhea.
- Return a diagnosis using ODA1 EBMeDS service.
